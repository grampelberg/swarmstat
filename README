SwarmStat
==========

SwarmStat is a system for tracking what is happening with swarms associated
with specific torrents over time and displaying this information. The concept
behind this project is to understand the dynamics of BitTorrent
swarms. Ideally, the trends that occur from torrents in both gaining
popularity, staying power and loosing popularity will come to the forefront.
